### Author: Matthew Renwick

### Links and Resources

Resourced Class 7 Zoom meeting/'Stephen' example for first Object Literal "Seattle." Worked out the other Objects for practice repitition. 

Grabbed from MDN docs:
 function randomavg(min,max){
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
}

### Reflections

This was a difficult lab to breakdown and understand. I'm still in the process of putting the pieces together. While Objects and Arrays are fairly simple to understand, putting the context in appropriately has been challenging. I'm still at the point where it's being figured out in my head, but when the correct notations are right in front of me I understand what's going on. It's taking information in the form of text - such as the problems we've been going through these last couple of days - and applying the correct format that's not quite lining up. In other words, my reading of these concepts - I feel like - is in good shape but my application is hurting. That's where I'll focus more of my attention going forward.
